For know we focus on spatial analyses and will later extend this to spatio-temporal analyses. Let \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) represent the spatial domain and let \\(\\mathbf{s}\\) be a spatial location. In general, we will let \\(\\mathcal{A} \\subset \\mathcal{D}\\) be a subdomain of the spatial region of \\(\\mathbf{D}\\). Insert Diagram from class here 3.2 Types of spatial data There are three primary types of spatial data that we are going to consider Geostatistical data Occur everywhere continuous support examples: temperature, precipitation Areal data Occur only over discrete areas can be thought of as an integral of a continuous process over a subdomain \\(\\mathcal{A} \\in \\mathcal{D}\\) examples: cases of a disease by counties, votes in an election by congressional district Point process data The count and location of the data are random examples: tornados, lightning strikes library(tidyverse) library(here) Many different file types for spatial data Typically data are in “flat files” like comma-seperated value (CSV) files read.csv(here(&quot;path&quot;, &quot;to&quot;, &quot;file.csv&quot;)) “shapefiles” which can be read using rgdal or maptools packages library(rgdal) library(maptools) “NetCDF” files cane be read using ncdf4 or RNetCDF library(ncdf4) library(RNetCDF) 3.3 Textbook package To install the data from the textbook, go to https://spacetimewithr.org/ and follow the link to the code. # install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) library(devtools) install_github(&quot;andrewzm/STRbook&quot;) Note that this package is relatively large because it contains a decent amount of spatial data. library(STRbook) "]
