Then, she predicts the counts at unobserved locations to estimate total crowd size. For multivariate normal data, the spatial correlation is easy to incorporate More challenging for non-Gaussian data Recall the Gaussian model: \\[\\begin{align*} y(\\mathbf{s}) | \\eta(\\mathbf{s}) &amp; \\stackrel{iid}{\\sim} N(\\mathbf{X}(\\mathbf{s} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\eta(\\mathbf{s}), \\sigma^2) \\\\ \\mathbf{\\eta} = (\\eta(\\mathbf{s}_1), \\ldots, \\eta(\\mathbf{s}_n))&#39; &amp; \\sim N(\\mathbf{0}, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}), \\end{align*}\\] where \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\) is the covariance matrix for the covariance function \\(\\tau^2 \\mathbf{C}(\\| \\mathbf{s} - \\mathbf{s}&#39; \\|)\\). If we integrate out the random effect \\(\\boldsymbol{\\eta}\\) we have the data \\(y(\\mathbf{s})\\) Instead, we add latent Gaussian random effects to the generalized linear model "]
